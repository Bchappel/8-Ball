This endeavor was a comprehensive exploration of various technologies and programming languages. The foundation is a physics library engineered in C and developed in a Linux Docker container. The library handles the intricate physics of ball collisions with table elements. The physics library is interfaced using SWIG to facilitate seamless communication between the C physics library and the Python-based game logic and web server. SQL is integrated into Python, providing data persistence and game management. The user interface is constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery, React JS). jQuery is utilized for managing interactions with the Python-based web server via AJAX POST requests and animates the ball's trajectory on the table within milliseconds of a shot. This fusion of technologies results in a responsive and captivating gaming experience.
